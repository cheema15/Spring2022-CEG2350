## Lab Procedure

For each part below, you will be asked to do an action or answer a question. The actions are going to be commands - you will write the command you used as "answers" to the action requested. You are allowed to use multiple commands to solve an action. Just write down all that were needed to complete. Check with the TAs if you need clarification.

If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences - writing them down will help you ask good questions later.

## Part 1 - AWS Academy Setup

An email was sent to your wright.edu account inviting you to join AWS Academy.  
Follow the instructions in [AWS Academy](../../AWSAcademy.md) to set up your AWS instance.
