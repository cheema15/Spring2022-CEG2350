## Lab Procedure

For each part below, you will be asked to do an action or answer a question. The actions are going to be commands - you will write the command you used as "answers" to the action requested. You are allowed to use multiple commands to solve an action. Just write down all that were needed to complete. Check with the TAs if you need clarification.

If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences - writing them down will help you ask good questions later.

## Part 1 - AWS Academy Setup

## Part 2 - git cloning

- **Useful commands for this part: `ssh-keygen`, `cat`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`**

4. In your repo folder, create a folder named `Lab02`
5. In the `Lab02` folder, create a file named `Lab02.md`
6. Paste the contents of the [LabTemplate.md](LabTemplate.md) into this file
7. `add` `Lab02.md` for tracking, `commit` changes as you go, and `push` to synchronize with GitHub
